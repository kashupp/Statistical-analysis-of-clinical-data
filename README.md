Teclistamab, a BCMAxCD3 bispecific antibody that has shown very promising results in clinical trials 
for the treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM).

It has been shown that overall response rate of 63% in patients 
with a minimum of three prior lines (Moreau, et al. N Engl J Med. 2022). 

This Python code is used to analyze the effect of drug in MM patients on a real-world data.
Specifically, it can provide methods for data preprocessing of continuous and categorical variables, that is, 
continuous variable data extraction and its grouping and constructing contingency table, respectively.
On the preprocessed data Kruskalâ€“Wallis test and Fisher's exact tests are applied.

It also calculates progression free survival (PFS) and provide a publication ready graph along with at risk counts.
It also provides information about median survival time and progression free survival timeline.

Programmatically, it provides example of class inheritance, method overloading and 
statistical analysis in Python.
