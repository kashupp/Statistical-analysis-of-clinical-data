Teclistamab, a BCMAxCD3 bispecific antibody that has shown very promising results in clinical trials 
for the treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM).

It has been shown that  overall response rate of 63% in patients 
with a minimum of three prior lines (Moreau, et al. N Engl J Med. 2022). 

This Python code is used to analyze the effect of drug on MM patients on a real world data.
Specifically, it can provide methods for data preprocessing of continious and categorical variables 
and then application of the Kruskalâ€“Wallis test and Fisher's exact test.

It also calculates progression free survival (PFS) and provide a publication ready graph along with at risk counts.
It also provide information about median survival time and progression free survival timeline.
